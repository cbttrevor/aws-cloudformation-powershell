## Learning Objectives

### Why PowerShell?

* PowerShell is cross-platform - automate from Linux, MacOS, or Windows consistently
* Object-oriented language built on .NET Framework makes it easy to prototype
* Enables automation of nearly any cloud resource via AWS APIs
* PowerShell integrates nicely with Microsoft Visual Studio Code so you can quickly prototype applications

### What is AWS CloudFormation?

* Template-based JSON or YAML configurations can be stored in source code repositories
* CloudFormation is a powerful tool that enables you to deploy cloud resources en masse
* Use CloudFormation StackSets to replicate configurations across AWS regions and even multiple accounts
* CloudFormation maintains an event history of what has changed in resource configurations

### Use Cases for PowerShell + AWS CloudFormation

* Automatically deploy infrastructure and applications every time a new AWS account is spun up
* Saves you lots of time cleaning up cloud resources that are costing you money
* Reduces attack surface by removing unnecessary cloud resources
